# LoadDll
Simple way to check if Windows DLL is loading or not.
It comes in two blends: 32 and 64 bits (LoadDll32.exe and LoadDll64.exe).

```
Usage:
        LoadDll32.exe my32bits.dll
        LoadDll64.exe my64bits.dll
```

Use side by side with an excellent [Dependencies](https://github.com/lucasg/Dependencies) program to troubleshoot DLL loading problems.
